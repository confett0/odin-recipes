    <p>These raspberry almond shortbread thumbprint cookies are delicious, pretty and festive.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>2/3 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon almond extract</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup seedless red raspberry jam</li>
        <li>sugar for sprinkling</li>
        <li>1 cup powdered sugar</li>
        <li>3 to 4 teaspoons water</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons almond extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium bowl beat butter medium speed for about 30 seconds. Add the the 2/3 cup granulated sugar and 1/2 teaspoon almond extract. Beat until well combined. Beat in as much flour as you can with electric mixer and then using a wooden spoon stir in any remaining flour. Cover and chill for 1 hour or until dough is easy to handle.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Shape dough into 1-inch balls. Place balls 2 inches apart on ungreased cookie sheets. Using your thumb, press an indentation into the center of each ball. Spoon about 1/2 teaspoon of the jam into each indentation and then sprinkle with sugar. Bake about 10 minutes or until edges are light brown. Cool on cookie sheets for 1 minute. Transfer cookies to wire racks to finish cooling.</li>
        <li>For icing, in a medium bowl combine powdered sugar, 1 teaspoon water and 1 1/2 teaspoons almond extract. Add enough of the remaining water to make a drizzling consistency. Drizzle cookies with icing.</li>
    </ol>
